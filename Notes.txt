The input fields in the AddressForm component get automatically cleared which is caused by React's StrictMode;
It causes the useEffect hook that is contained in the Checkout component to run twice (or sometimes even three times),
which in turn causes the inputs to re-render(?) resulting in potential loss of user input.
That only happens when React's StrictMode is utilized and only on dev, not on production.
